# The Malaga-Streetview-Challenge Dataset
This is the public release of the Malaga Streetview Challenge dataset that is used in these papers to 
benchmark Visual Localization task under changing conditions:

```
Cinaroglu,  I.,  Bastanlar,  Y.:  
Image  based  localization  using  semantic  segmentation  forautonomous driving.  
In: 2019 27th Signal Processing and Communications ApplicationsConference (SIU), pp. 1–4. IEEE (2019)
```

```
Cinaroglu, I., Bastanlar, Y.: 
Training semantic descriptors for image-based localization. 
In:ECCV 2020 Workshop on Perception for Autonomous Driving(PAD). ECCV (23 August2020)
```

The dataset is based on the Málaga Stereo and Laser Urban Dataset (Downtown subpart) described in this paper:

```
